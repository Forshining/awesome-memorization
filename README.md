# awesome-memorization
Focusing on everything on the memorization of foundation models with the interaction of following topics from both empirical and theoretical view(esp. statistical view):
- Memorization and Generalization
- Memorization, Forgetting and Machine Unlearning
- Memorization in Diffusion Models
- Memorization in Security&Privacy, including differential privacy, privacy attacks, etc
- Memorization and noisy learning
- Memorization and data distribution/model architecture
